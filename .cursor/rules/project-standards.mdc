# Attachments Library Project Standards

## Project Context
This is the **attachments** library - a Python package for processing various document formats (PDF, PPTX, etc.) with a pipeline-based architecture and DSL command system.

## Core Philosophy
- **Literate Programming**: All demos should follow Jupyter cell format with proper markdown documentation
- **Type Safety**: Use comprehensive type hints throughout
- **Pipeline Architecture**: Follow load → modify → present → refine pattern
- **DSL Commands**: Provide intuitive command syntax for users
- **Extensibility**: Make it easy to add new formats and processors

## Communication Style
- Be concise and focused in explanations
- Use technical terminology appropriately
- Provide concrete examples when explaining concepts
- Reference existing patterns in the codebase

## Code Generation Preferences
- Prioritize readability and maintainability
- Follow established patterns in the codebase
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Include appropriate error handling
- Add type hints to all new code

## Documentation Standards
- Use docstrings for all public APIs
- Include DSL command documentation in processor docstrings
- Provide usage examples in docstrings

## When Creating New Features
- Follow the existing architecture patterns
- Create demo files using literate programming style
- Update relevant documentation
- DO NOT ADD BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY we are pre-release
